I'm a software developer from The Netherlands, with over a decade of software
development experience. I'm the author of and work full-time on the [Inko
programming language](https://inko-lang.org). Please consider supporting my work
by donating using [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/YorickPeterse).
Before working on Inko, I worked as a [Staff Backend
Engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/#staff-backend-engineer)
at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com). For more details, refer to my
[resume](/resume).

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/yorickpeterse),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse) and
[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/user/yorickpeterse). If you wish to contact me
through Email, my Email address is `yorick` at this domain name. I'm not
interested in unsolicited Emails from recruiters, and mark such Emails as spam.

I sign my Git commits using [these SSH public keys](/ssh_keys.txt). In the past
I used [this GPG key](/gpg_key.txt) for signing Git commits, but the key is no
longer in use.
