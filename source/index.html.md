  The personal website of Yorick Peterse, a software developer from The
  Netherlands.

I'm a software developer from The Netherlands, with over a decade of software
development experience. I'm the author of and work full-time on the [Inko
programming language](https://inko-lang.org). Please consider supporting my work
by donating using [GitHub Sponsors][github-sponsors]. Before working on Inko, I
worked as a [Staff Backend Engineer][staff-backend-engineer] at
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com). For more details, refer to my
[resume](/resume).

You can find me on [GitLab][@gitlab], [GitHub][@github], [Twitter][twitter],
[Reddit][reddit] and [lobste.rs][lobsters]. If you wish to contact me through
Email, my Email address is `yorick` at this domain name. I'm not interested in
unsolicited Emails from recruiters, and mark such Emails as spam.

I sign my Git commits using [these SSH public keys](/ssh_keys.txt). In the past
I used [this GPG key](/gpg_key.txt) for signing Git commits, but the key is no
longer in use.
