I'm a software developer from The Netherlands, with over a decade of software
development experience. I work at [GitLab][gitlab] as a [Staff Backend
Engineer][staff-backend-engineer].

I'm interested in the development and theory of compilers, virtual machines,
garbage collectors, and programming languages. I'm also the author of the [Inko
programming language][inko]. If you'd like to support my work on free and
open-source software, you can do so using [GitHub Sponsors][github-sponsors].

You can find me on [GitLab][@gitlab], [GitHub][@github], [Twitter][twitter],
[Reddit][reddit] and [lobste.rs][lobsters]. If you wish to contact me through
Email, my Email address is `yorick` at this domain name. Emails sent by
recruiters will be marked as spam.

My GPG public key is [EB691AC9][gpg-key]. Other keys registered on my name are
no longer in use.
