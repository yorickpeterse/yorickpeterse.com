  The personal website of Yorick Peterse, a software developer from The
  Netherlands.

I'm a software developer from The Netherlands, with over a decade of software
development experience. I work at [GitLab][gitlab] as a [Staff Backend
Engineer][staff-backend-engineer].

I'm interested in the development and theory of compilers, virtual machines,
garbage collectors, and programming languages. I'm also the author of the [Inko
programming language][inko]. If you'd like to support my work on free and
open-source software, you can do so using [GitHub Sponsors][github-sponsors].

You can contact me via [Email](mailto:yorick@yorickpeterse.com),
[Twitter][twitter], or [Reddit][reddit]; though I prefer Email. You can also
find me on [GitLab][@gitlab] and [GitHub][@github]. Please do **not** contact me
if you are a recruiter.

My GPG public key is [EB691AC9][gpg-key] registered using Email address
yorick@yorickpeterse.com. Other keys registered on my name are no longer in use.
